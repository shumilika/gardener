            <p>
                As the weather warms and plants begin to emerge from their winter dormancy, spring is an ideal time to give your 
                garden a fresh start. Our Spring Clean-up services focus on preparing your garden for the growing season ahead by 
                removing winter debris, pruning shrubs and trees, dividing perennials, and cultivating soil. We also assess your

                Our Fall Clean-up services focus on clearing away fallen leaves, cutting back spent foliage, and tidying up garden 
                beds to prepare for winter dormancy. We also assess your garden for any seasonal tasks such as bulb planting,

            </p>
            <h3>Winter Preparation</h3>
            <p>
                Winter may seem like a time of rest for your garden, but it's essential to take proactive steps to protect your plants 
                and soil during the colder months. Our Winter Preparation services focus on tasks such as wrapping tender plants, 
                applying protective mulch, and cleaning and storing garden tools and equipment. We also provide guidance on winter 
                watering, snow removal, and monitoring for signs of cold damage to ensure that your garden survives the winter and
